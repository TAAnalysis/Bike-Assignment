## General Information
- To gain understanding about what are the variables impacting the target variable.
- Background of your Assignment -> To understand the factors affecting bike sharing services.
- Business problem solution -> Predicting future of the requirement of the services so the company can increase the infrastructure to provide better service.
- The dataset used -> The data is provided by the company with all the possible variables impacting the usage of bike sharing service.

<!-- You don't have to answer all the questions - just the ones relevant to your project. -->

## Conclusions
- The r2 score of 79% was obtained on the Training dataset when compared to Test dataset it was 78%, which is a decent prediction from the model.
- The dependent variable cnt (count) is highly correlated with the independent variables yr(year) and temp(temperature).
